## 2025-01-29 - Concierge UX Polishing
**Learning:** For interactive overlay panels like the AI Concierge, user intent is high. Auto-focusing the input and auto-scrolling to new content are critical for maintaining conversation flow. Providing visual feedback (typing indicator) during simulated "thinking" significantly reduces perceived latency and improves the user's perception of the AI as an active assistant.
**Action:** Always implement auto-focus, auto-scroll, and state-based interaction feedback for chat-like interfaces to ensure a seamless "Imperial" experience.

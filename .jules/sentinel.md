**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded API key injection via `vite.config.ts` and unseparated prompt instructions in `services/gemini.ts`.
**Learning:** The application was using an `importmap` in `index.html` which conflicted with Vite's bundling, causing a blank screen. Also, model identifiers were outdated/hallucinated (e.g., `gemini-3`).
**Prevention:** Always use `SYSTEM:` and `USER INSTRUCTIONS:` prefixes for prompt injection protection. Rely on ambient authentication (`new GoogleGenAI()`) instead of injecting keys into the client build. Ensure `index.html` correctly loads the entry point via a module script tag.
